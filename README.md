# Transliterator

This application transliterates text containing 2-character combinations that represent German and Portuguese vowels not found on US keyboards.

For example if you write pa;o, in the upper text field, it will be transliterated as p√£o in the lower text field.

I wrote my first iteration of this program as a CGI perl script about 20 years ago.  I thought it might be an interesting introduction to Ember.js to re-implement it
as an Ember.js application.

No back-end server required. It just reads text typed, (or pasted) into one textarea and transliterates it to another text area.

Coming from a ruby-on-rails background with jQuery for the front end, I was forced to change my thinking, my frame-of-reference-for-doing things. Normally given a [Help] button on a page, I would catch the event and put up a help dialog.  However in this iteration, both the [Help] button and the text of the help dialog become a sub-component, and the action just toggles the value of a variable used to control the display of the help text.
